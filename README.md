# dog: a cat-like cli tool üêï

You probably heard of and used [cat](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) in Linux. Now be ready for
the arrival of dog! An experimental toy-example command line tool similar to cat to showcase three different methods of command line
argument parsing in C++.

I wrote a blog article about it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mostsignificant/3-ways-to-parse-command-line-arguments-in-c-quick-do-it-yourself-or-comprehensive-36913284460f) or here on [mostsignificant.github.io](https://mostsignificant.github.io/c++/2021/11/03/3-ways-to-parse-command-line-arguments-in-C++-quick-do-it-yourself-or-comprehensive.html) where you can follow along. The three different methods reside on different branches. The main branch is reserved for
further development and C++ showcasing in future blog articles.

This branch shows the external-lib method of parsing incoming command line arguments.
