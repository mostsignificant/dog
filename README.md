# dog: a cat-like cli tool üêï 

You probably heard of and used [cat](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) in Linux. Now be ready for
the arrival of dog! A command line tool similar to cat to showcase three different methods of command line argument
parsing in C++.

I wrote a blog article about it on Medium or here on [mostsignificant.github.io](https://mostsignificant.github.io)
where you can follow along. The three different methods reside on different branches. The main branch is reserved for
further development and C++ showcasing in future blog articles.

This branch shows the quick-and-dirty method of directly using argv and argc throughout the code.
